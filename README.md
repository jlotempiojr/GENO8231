# GENO8231
Repository for GENO8231 coursework at GWU/CNMC

**Notes as of Tuesday 19 March**

Scripts herein were designed for the analysis of N-Acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) protein sequence variable domain (VD). The startpoints and endpoints of these domains are variable and as such, at this time, require user modifcation of the R scripts to account for these differences. 

Shell scripts require R scripts to be saved in the same dirctory.
